# Quick Sort Algorithm

## Description
This project implements the Quick Sort algorithm, a fast sorting algorithm using the "divide and conquer" strategy. It recursively divides the input array into smaller subarrays and sorts them. It's highly efficient with average time complexity of O(n log n).

## Features
- Implements Quick Sort in multiple programming languages.
- Sorts arrays with high efficiency.

## Usage
1. Provide an unsorted array.
2. The algorithm sorts the array in place.
